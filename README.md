# C - Stacks, Queues - LIFO, FIFO
This project is to learn about the data structures on C.
## Learnin objectives
* What do LIFO and FIFO mean
* What is a stack, and when to use it
* What is a queue, and when to use it
* What are the common implementations of stacks and queues
* What are the most common use cases of stacks and queues
* What is the proper way to use global variables
## Opcodes
Opcodes | Description
:---: | ---
push | pushes an element to the stack
pall | prints all the values on the stack, starting from the top of the stack
pint | prints the value at the top of the stack, followed by a new line
pop | removes the top element of the stack
swap | swaps the top two elements of the stack
add | adds the top two elements of the stack
nop | doesnâ€™t do anything
